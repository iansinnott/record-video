# Record Video

A simple example of recording with the front camera in a mobile browser.

**NOTE:** This works in Safari, but I had trouble with mobile Firefox on iOS.

## Code

Most of the code here is just for creating the UI to let you upload a video, but the core functionality is provided by the browser. Use the `capture` property to tell the browser which camera you want to use. The options are: 

* `"user"` for the front-facing camera.
* `"environment"` for the back-facing camera.

Example:

```html
<input
  type="file"
  accept="video/*"
  capture="user"
/>
```
